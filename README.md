Weekend Homework

Hatchery is a Rails 5 API for a hypothetical farmer who has eggs to tally and give away to his friends.

Accessing the WeatherUnderground API for current weather updates, the farmers customers
are able to check in on how his chickens are doing.

Hatchery enables this farmers friends to select any amount of eggs out of those available.
